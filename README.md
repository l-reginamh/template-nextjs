This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
#or
pnpm install
#or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

We can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

If we would like to have more pages, create a new folder under `app/` and then create the `app/routeName/page.tsx`. We can then access the new page by [http://localhost:3000/routeName](http://localhost:3000/routeName)

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for the css classes. And [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the ready made components that we can redesign to suite our theme.
